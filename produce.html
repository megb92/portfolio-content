Alaska is one of the best places to grow 'brassicas'- cold hardy veggies in the broccoli family. This includes cauliflower,
cabbage, kohlrabi, and brussels sprouts. Carrots and tough greens like kale and chard also grow well and can survive
early fall frost and snow.

Crops that need warmer weather, like tomatoes, salad greens, and cucumbers, must be grown in a warm greenhouse or only
during the short warm season in July and August.

Sometimes, all the sunlight, good soil, and rainfall make fast-growing vegetables go a little crazy. Farmers laugh at the
many-legged carrots and oversized onions in their fields.
