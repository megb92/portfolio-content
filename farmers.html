The Matanuska valley was colonized by white settlers from the lower 48 United States during the New Deal era, two decades 
before Alaska officially became a state. The Matanuska colony established settled agriculture in Alaska with row crops,
beef cattle herds, dairy farms, and newly built towns. It also effectively ended native Athabascans use of the region for 
hunting and gathering.

Throughout Alaska, indigenous peoples continue to live in their ancestral homelands. Alaska did not experience as much of a removal
and reservation program as the rest of the United States. However, remote villages experience a lack of access to consistent
healthcare and often subsist on preserved processed foods imported from outside the state as traditional food production methods
have fallen off.

To work against this issue, several Alaska Native tribal corporations and the Alaska Native Health Center in Anchorage have 
started sponsoring farmers markets where Native peoples and others can buy and sell fresh produce. The ANHC also aims to serve 
culturally appropriate foods sourced from the local region to its patients.
