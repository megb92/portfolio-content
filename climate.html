<p>Alaska really does have cold, dark, and snowy winters. Most of the state goes through a period of weeks every winter when
the sun never rises above the horizon. But this is balanced by lovely and mild summers. In the Matanuska Valley near Anchorage,
the sun stays up all night through most of July, and temperatures range from 50-75 degrees Fahrenheit. All this 
sunlight is great for growing plants, and vegetables love to soak up the rays.</p>

<p>Alaska is bordered by several glaciated mountain ranges including the Talkeetnas, the Chugach, and the Alaska range.
The minerals in glacial run-off make soil in the surrounding valleys extra rich and healthy for agricultural use. But the soil
is cold and doesn't warm up enough to keep plants happy until very late in the spring. To solve this problem, Alaska farmers
make use of various greenhouses for warm-weather plants, and use fabric row cover to insulate tender salad greens in the field.</p>

<p>One other hazard of Alaskan vegetable farming is the local wildlife. Moose love a chance to snack on tasty fresh produce (especially cabbage)
and tall moose fences are necessary to keep the farm safe.</p>

<p>Climate change has been both good and bad for Alaskan farmers. Warming temps (while destroying glaciers and snowfall) create longer
growing seasons and make it possible to grow tender crops like tomatoes. On the other hand, the number of forest fires
across the state has been increasing every year and the resulting smoke drifts across vast areas, blocking sunlight
and making breathing difficult for those who work outside all day.</p>
