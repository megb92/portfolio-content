The state of Alaska is often thought of as a cold and snowy wasteland full of bears and caribou. While
this is true in the northern parts of the state, much of southern and south-central Alaska are much more mild.
Alaska is a surprisingly good place to grow vegetables and grains, and agriculture is a growing industry for the state.
Long summer days and rich soil make a good environment for growing large veggies. The Alaska State Fair holds a famous
annual contest for the largest home-grown pumpkin and cabbage, and the winners usually weigh in at several hundred pounds.

However, food security (access to healthy and affordable food) is a challenge for Alaskans. The growing season is short
and there are not enough farms to feed the population. Most food is still imported from outside of the state, especially
during the long winter. Alaskans are anxious to develop a strong local farming system in case outside supplies are ever 
cut off.

Alaska Natives play an important role in maintaining and changing local food practices. Native groups have a long history of
hunting, fishing, and gathering food across their ancestral homelands. As Alaskan cities have grown, more native peoples are
losing touch with traditional foodways and eating unhealthy diets of imported processed foods. Reclaiming native practices and 
foods are important projects for the future health of Alaskans.
